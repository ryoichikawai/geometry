# Introduction

In this book, we shall call the physics developed before Einstein's relativity theory _classical_ physics and the physics after it _modern_ physics.  Do not get confused with classical vs quantum physics.

## Conceptual Objectives

In classical physics, space and time are two separated concepts.  The time flows at constant rate only toward future.  We assign each moment of time a real number, $t \in \mathbb{R}$. On the other hand, we can move in any direction in the space. We assign the space a coordinate system. For one dimensional space,  we assign each point a real number $x \in \mathbb{R}$. For $3$-dimensional space, a point is expressed with $n$ real numbers, $\{x^1, x^2, x^3\} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ .  Combining space and time, we have a _spacetime_ coordinate system $\{t, x^1,x^2,x^3\} \in \mathbb{R}^4$, which  we call  Euclidean spacetime

The assignment of numbers to space and time is arbitrary.  We choose a coordinate system at our discretion.  Once the choice is made, it can be used by any one, some one on the Earth and another person on the Mars can use the same Euclidean spacetime.

The theory of classical physics are describe by mathematical methods, namely _Euclidean geometry and  calculus_ on it.   Every physics student is familiar with them. However,  Einstein told us that such mathematical descriptions are only approximately valid.  The structure of spacetime is much more complicated and cannot be described by a simple $\mathbb{R}^4$.  To describe the new physics, we cannot use familiar  mathematical tools such as Euclidean geometry and  calculus.  We need new mathematical tools to describe the new physics  without using spacetime coordinates (a _coordinate free_ approach).  Since most of mathematical tools we are familiar with rely on Euclidean coordinates system, we must redefine them without coordinate systems.  Some mathematical tools such as addition/subtraction or absolute values are even not defined in the abstract mathematical structure.  

Since we are so familiar with the Euclidean coordinates, it is very difficult to get rid of it from our brain.  In fact, our daily experience is perfectly consistent with the Euclidean spacetime.  Hence, the new mathematics is necessarily abstract (no direct relation with the reality we are experiencing).  However, physics describes actual events we can measure in the traditional spacetime coordinate system.  There must be a certain connection between abstract coordinate free theory and traditional physics based on the Euclidean spacetime.

The connection is provided by the theory of _manifolds_.  The coordinate free theory is constructed based on the concept of _topological space_  In turn, the manifolds connects the topological space to Euclidean spacetime continuous mappings.  The key point is that no single spacetime coordinate system can describe all evens happening in the universe.  The universe is covered by many patches of different Euclideans spacetime.  

On each Euclidean sspacetime, we can use the traditional concepts of geometry and calculus.  However, it cannot be extended to other parts of the universe.  We must use a different spacetime coordinates once we go beyond the limit of the first spacetime coordinates.  On the other hand, physics is not fragmented.  What happened here and there may be causally related.  Thus a certain relation between two spacetime coordinates must exist.  The theory of manifolds provides the relation betweens the patches of spacetime coordinates so that we can follow a series of events continuously.

In summary, the theory of manifolds provides new definitions of mathematical objects and operations between them such as vector and inner products.  And it also tells us how to connect them to familiar mathematics on Euclidean spacetime.



## Simple example

Suppose that we are restricted on the ground and that we can move only along the surface of the Earth.  Despite that the Earth is spherical,  we feel that we are on a flat surface, which is mathematically speaking a two-dimensional Euclidean space ($\mathbb{R}^2$).  WE put a sheet of paper on the desk and draw a triangle. We know that the sum of three inner angles equals $\pi$.  This is a signature of Euclidean space.  Two infinitely long straight lines intersect at one point  or otherwise  never intersect (parallel to each other).    

But these geometric properties of the Euclidean space do not hold if we look at a larger scale.  First, we need to define what is a straight line on the surface of a sphere.  Supposedly we can say that the straight line is the shortest  connecting two points.  But, what is the distance on the sphere?   We will define a concept of distance later using the concept of _metric_.
