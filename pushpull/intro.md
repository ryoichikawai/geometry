# Covariant vs Contravariant



When we deal with curved space,  we often move from one manifold to another manifold.  Then, we often look at the same mathematical object from different manifolds.   For example, consider a two manifolds $M$ and $N$. A map $\phi: M \rightarrow N$ connects point $p$  on $M$ to $q$ on $N$.  The direction of the map is important here.  Then, we ask how a function $f$, a tangent vector $v_p \in T_pM$,  and cotangent vector $\omega_p \in T^*_p M$ on $M$ look like on $N$, and vice versa.

Some objects can be transported in the same direction as $\phi$ but not in the other way.  Others can be transported only in the backward direction with respect to the map $\phi$.  The former transportation is called `pushforward` and the latter is known as `pullback`.  When objects are transported by pushforward, they are said to be `covariant` and those by pullback are `contravariant`. 

In the following sections, we will find that tangent vectors are covariant, and  functions and cotangent vectors are contravariant.
