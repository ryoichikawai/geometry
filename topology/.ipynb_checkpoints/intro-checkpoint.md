# Topological Space


Differential geometry is a key mathematical tool in modern physics.  Despite of its importance, many physics textbooks introduce it only briefly.  On the other hand advanced mathematical physics books emphasize mathematical rigor without detailed connection to physics.  In fact, most of modern textbooks on differential geometry begin with topological space.  However, most physicists never define a topology they are using.  So, do we have to learn topological space?

Since physicists don't use the precise mathematics of topological space, indeed many books skip explicit discussions of the topological space. However, when differentiable manifolds are introduced, the concepts of topological space are implicitly used.  In some cases, the lack of mathematical background causes confusions.  In particular, the concepts of topology is necessary to build smooth functions in non-Euclidean space.

In this chapter, we briefly review the basics of topological space and discuss how to construct smooth functions essential to physics.  We need it to define vector fields and differentials of functions on curved space.
