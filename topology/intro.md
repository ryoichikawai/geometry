# Topological Space

Differential geometry is a key mathematical tool in modern physics.  Despite of its importance, many physics textbooks only briefly introduce it .  On the other hand advanced mathematical physics books emphasize mathematical rigor without detailed connection to physics.  In fact, its relevance to physics is very strong and should be discussed.

Most of modern textbooks on differential geometry begin with topological space.  However, most physics books skip explicit discussions about it.  The concept of  topological space is rarely used in physics.  If we can describe  physics without it, why do we have to learn it?

 Even when differentiable manifolds are introduced without the concepts of topological space, physicists are implicitly using it.  Actually, the lack of proper introduction to topological space is a major source of confusion in physics books.

We need topological space  to define continuous functions, which is one reason we need it in physics.  Recall that most of functions used in physics are continuous except for a few exceptions.  The definition of continuous functions is intuitive in the Euclidean space,  but not so in the curved spaces.  The main goal of this chapter is to define continuous functions in arbitrary spaces.  That is a starting point of the development of calculus on the curved spaces.

In the following sections, you will see that the mathematical concept of open sets is exclusively used.  Mathematically, we can develop an equivalent mathematical construction  using only closed sets with a little inconvenience.  There are reason why physics wants to use open sets.  Many physical quantities corresponds to open sets.  For example, a position of a particle is not exactly a point in a mathematical sense.  It is a neighborhood of a point.  More precisely,  it is an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a point, which is an open set.  We do not want to have  the sharp boundary of closed sets in physics.
